In "Task 1",the goal is to Create a function that processes an array of numbers, squaring even numbers and tripling odd numbers.
We use the map method to iterate over the array.
For each element, we check if it is even or odd using the modulo operator (%).
We square the number if it's even, and triple it if it's odd.

In "Task 2", I Create a function that formats an array of strings based on corresponding processed numbers.
Capitalize the entire string if the number is even.
Convert the string to lowercase if the number is odd.
Use map to iterate over strings.
Change case based on the corresponding number's parity.

In "Task 3" I Create user profiles from names with unique IDs.
